# Proposed PAUEP ideas 

*A documentary basis for Python Advocacy and Community in Australia*

# What is a “PAUEP”?

Inspired by the excellent work of our own Alyssa Coghlan on the PEP system used by the PSF and PSC, PAUEP is a stand-in name for a Python Australia Enhancement Proposal. The seminal work can be found [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/). 

This document will be used to brainstorm and track who is doing work on various PAUEPs, and whether or not the documents will have an impact on the constitution of any body that results from these discussions. PAUEP 1 is designed as an equivalent to PEP 1, which demonstrates the guidelines for PEPs as it describes them. 

Of note: the titles in this table are not final \- they’re only to set the gist of the document and may change as the team involved sets their direction.

Also of note: the intent is to have PAUEPs be markdown files in Github similar to the way that PEPs are managed.
