# What is a “PAEP”?

PAEP stands for "Python Australia Enhancement Proposal". Like their namesake PEPs (described in
[PEP 1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/)), PAEPs are a mechanism by which proposal authors can
put forward specific ideas for organizational improvement, collect and collate feedback on the
proposal, and ultimately seek final resolution for the proposal. Refer to the
[PAEP guidelines](https://github.com/python-australia/paeps/blob/main/paep-1-purpose/README.md)
for additional details.
