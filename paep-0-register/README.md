# PAEP Register

This is the index of all Python Australia Enhancement Proposals, known as PAEPs.
PAEP numbers are assigned by the repository maintainers, and once assigned are never changed.
The version control history of the PAEP texts represent their historical record.

Note: the structure of this page is not final (and ideally will be replaced by a page
that is automatically generated from the individual PAEP metadata)
