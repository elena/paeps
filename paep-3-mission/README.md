# Proposed Mission for Python Australia

This proposal consists of two primary sections: the draft mission statement itself,
and then an annotated version of the mission statement that discusses key phrases
and each individual clause in detail.

## Draft Mission Statement

The following text is proposed as the full mission statement for Python Australia:

> The mission of Python Australia is to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse
> Australian community of Python programmers.
>
> Python Australia pursues that mission by:
>
> * encouraging and facilitating the organisation of Python related user groups and
>   community workshops in Australia;
> * encouraging and facilitating the adoption of Python, and Python related technology,
>   in Australian educational, professional, and enthusiast settings;
> * encouraging and facilitating the provision of Python related conferences in Australia;
> * encouraging and facilitating long-term relationships, financial or otherwise, with entities
>   that wish to support, and effectively engage with, the Australian Python community;
> * facilitating the involvement of Python Australia members in the wider
>   international Python community;
> * facilitating the involvement of Python Australia members in the wider
>   open source community;
> * facilitating Python related research in the public interest;
> * engaging with regulatory bodies and other government agencies and industry organisations
>   as necessary to protect the interests of Python Australia members;
> * raising and managing funds to support the above activities in compliance with
>   non-profit regulations in Australia; and
> * providing services in support of the above activities. This includes,
>   but is not limited to, operating a public website and social media presence.
>
> Python Australia is an independent Australian entity that is not formally affiliated
> with the Python Software Foundation. However, this mission statement is intended to be
> compatible with, and actively support, the global mission of the Python Software Foundation.

## Annotated Mission Statement

### Overall structure

The overall structure of the draft mission statement is inspired by the structure of
the [Python Software Foundation mission statement](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/),
with an additional clause that makes the lack of any formal relationship between the
Australian entity and the US-based Python Software Foundation explicit. The goals of
the two organisations align (since Python Australia's mission statement is intentionally
designed that way), but they're not affiliated in any legal governance sense.

This structure presents an initial "essential" mission statement, following by several
more detailed "activity" clauses which are intended to provide a clear shared understanding
of what activities are considered to be reasonable uses of the organisation's resources.

For the draft mission statement, the activity clauses are organised in a rough order of
strategic priority, with later clauses generally representing activities that are arguably
already covered by clauses earlier in the list. Those clauses are included primarily to
avoid having to have those potential arguments in the future by explicitly declaring
those activities as being covered by the organisation's scope.

### Key words and phrases

Some key words and phrases appear multiple times in the mission statement. Rather than
repeating the rationale for these clauses in multiple places, they are instead described
collectively here:

* "Australian": the mission statement intentionally *doesn't* define the word "Australian"
  (and the organisation's constitution probably won't either). If folks consider themselves
  part of the Australian Python community, regardless of their current physical location,
  we're willing to take their word for it (at least as far as non-voting membership goes).
* "Python Australia members": this refers specifically to people that are considered members
  of the organisation under the organisation's constitution (which is expected to include
  a pseudonymous non-voting fee-free "I want to be a member of Python Australia" tier).
* "in Australia": this phrasing is used when the clause is specifically intended to refer to
  jurisdictions covered by the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia (since Python Australia
  as a legal entity will operate within that jurisdiction).
* "encouraging and facilitating": these are the potential activities which are considered
  to most directly fulfil the essential mission of the organisation. When activity in
  these areas seems lacking, the organisation should be taking active steps to understand
  any barriers that are in place, and seek to resolve them.
* "facilitating": these are activities which are considered to be closely related to the
  essential mission of the organisation, but not as directly as the clauses that use the
  "encouraging and facilitating" phrasing. When activity in these areas seems lacking,
  the organisation *may* still take active steps to understand any barriers that are in
  place, but it isn't necessarily something that would be prioritised over other concerns.

### The essential mission statement

The first paragraph of the mission statement reads:

> The mission of Python Australia is to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse
> Australian community of Python programmers.

This gives the "essence" of the overall mission: supporting a diverse "Australian" community
of Python programmers.

It is a near direct quote of the second half of the PSF's own essential mission statement
(with the word "Australian" replacing the text "and international" from the PSF original):

> The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to ..., and to support and facilitate
> the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.


### The "community" activity clause

The first ("community") activity clause reads:

> * encouraging and facilitating the organisation of Python related user groups and
>   community workshops in Australia;

TODO: explain the rationale

### The "Python adoption" activity clause

The second ("Python adoption" or "career path") activity clause reads:

> * encouraging and facilitating the adoption of Python, and Python related technology,
>   in Australian educational, professional, and enthusiast settings;

TODO: explain the rationale

### The "conference" activity clause

The third ("conference") activity clause reads:

> * encouraging and facilitating the provision of Python related conferences in Australia;

TODO: explain the rationale

### The "relationship management" activity clause

The fourth ("relationship management") activity clause reads:

> * encouraging and facilitating long-term relationships, financial or otherwise, with entities
>   that wish to support, and effectively engage with, the Australian Python community;

TODO: explain the rationale

### The "international Python engagement" activity clause

The fifth ("international Python engagement") activity clause reads:

> * facilitating the involvement of Python Australia members in the wider
>   international Python community;

TODO: explain the rationale

### The "open source participation" activity clause

The sixth ("open source participation") activity clause reads:

> * facilitating the involvement of Python Australia members in the wider
>   open source community;

TODO: explain the rationale

### The "research" activity clause

The seventh ("research") activity clause reads:

> * facilitating Python related research in the public interest;

TODO: explain the rationale

### The "member advocacy" activity clause

The eighth ("member advocacy") activity clause reads:

> * engaging with regulatory bodies and other government agencies and industry organisations

TODO: explain the rationale

### The organisational independence statement

The final organisational independence statement reads:

> Python Australia is an independent Australian entity that is not formally affiliated
> with the Python Software Foundation. However, this mission statement is intended to be
> compatible with, and actively support, the global mission of the Python Software Foundation.
