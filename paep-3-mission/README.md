# Proposed Mission for Python Australia

This proposal consists of two primary sections: the draft mission statement itself,
and then an annotated version of the mission statement that discusses key phrases
and each individual clause in detail.

## Draft Mission Statement

The following text is proposed as the full mission statement for Python Australia:

> The mission of Python Australia is to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse
> Australian community of Python programmers.
>
> Python Australia pursues that mission by:
>
> * encouraging and facilitating the organisation of Python related user groups and
>   community workshops in Australia;
> * encouraging and facilitating the adoption of Python, and Python related technology,
>   in Australian educational, professional, and enthusiast settings;
> * encouraging and facilitating the provision of Python related conferences in Australia;
> * encouraging and facilitating long-term relationships, financial or otherwise, with entities
>   that wish to support, and effectively engage with, the Australian Python community;
> * facilitating the involvement of Python Australia members in the wider
>   international Python community;
> * facilitating the involvement of Python Australia members in the wider
>   open source community;
> * facilitating Python related research in the public interest;
> * engaging with regulatory bodies and other government agencies and industry organisations
>   as necessary to protect the interests of Python Australia members;
> * raising and managing funds to support the above activities in compliance with
>   non-profit regulations in Australia; and
> * providing services in support of the above activities. This includes,
>   but is not limited to, operating a public website and social media presence.
>
> Python Australia is an independent legal entity incorporated in Australia that is not formally
> affiliated with the Python Software Foundation. However, this mission statement is intended to
> be compatible with, and actively support, the global mission of the Python Software Foundation.

## Annotated Mission Statement

### Overall structure

The overall structure of the draft mission statement is inspired by the structure of
the [Python Software Foundation mission statement](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/),
with an additional clause that makes the lack of any formal relationship between the
Australian entity and the US-based Python Software Foundation explicit. The goals of
the two organisations align (since Python Australia's mission statement is intentionally
designed that way), but they're not affiliated in any legal governance sense.

This structure presents an initial "essential" mission statement, followed by several
more detailed "activity" clauses which are intended to provide a clear shared understanding
of what activities are considered to be reasonable uses of the organisation's resources.

For the draft mission statement, the activity clauses are organised in a rough order of
strategic priority, with later clauses generally representing activities that are arguably
already covered by clauses earlier in the list. Those clauses are included primarily to
avoid having to have those potential arguments in the future by explicitly declaring
those activities as being covered by the organisation's scope.

### Key words and phrases

Some key words and phrases appear multiple times in the mission statement. Rather than
repeating the rationale for these clauses in multiple places, they are instead described
collectively here:

* "Australian": the mission statement intentionally *doesn't* define the word "Australian"
  (and the organisation's constitution probably won't either). If folks consider themselves
  part of the Australian Python community, regardless of their current physical location,
  we're willing to take their word for it (at least as far as non-voting membership goes).
* "Python Australia members": this refers specifically to people that are considered members
  of the organisation under the organisation's constitution (which is expected to include
  a pseudonym-friendly non-voting fee-free "I want to be a member of Python Australia" tier).
* "in Australia": this phrasing is used when the clause is specifically intended to refer to
  jurisdictions covered by the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia (since Python Australia
  as a legal entity will be incorporated within that regulatory framework).
* "Python related": this phrasing is used to make it clear that the organisation may be
  involved in supporting events that aren't specifically about Python itself, but instead
  are about fields of activity where Python naturally features heavily due to a
  significant presence in that field.
* "encouraging and facilitating": these are the potential activities which are considered
  to most directly fulfil the essential mission of the organisation. When activity in
  these areas seems lacking, the organisation should be taking active steps to understand
  any barriers that are in place, and seeking to resolve them.
* "facilitating": these are activities which are considered to be closely related to the
  essential mission of the organisation, but not as directly as the clauses that use the
  "encouraging and facilitating" phrasing. When activity in these areas seems lacking,
  the organisation *may* still take active steps to understand any barriers that are in
  place, but it isn't necessarily something that would be prioritised over other concerns.

The mission statement also intentionally avoids any phrasing that implies a gatekeeping role
or a centralised command and control model. The Australian Python community already exists,
and will continue to exist with or without a formal legal entity supporting it. One of the
goals of the phrasing choices is making it clear Python Australia should be an organisation
that aims to support its members in undertaking activities that they were considering
undertaking anyway, rather than actively telling them what they *should* be doing.

### The essential mission statement

The first paragraph of the mission statement reads:

> The mission of Python Australia is to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse
> Australian community of Python programmers.

This gives the essence of the overall mission that drives all of the more specific
activity clauses: supporting a diverse "Australian" community of Python programmers.

It is a near direct quote of the second half of the PSF's own essential mission statement
(with the word "Australian" replacing the text "and international" from the PSF original):

> The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to ..., and to support and facilitate
> the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.


### The "community" activity clause

The first ("community") activity clause reads:

> * encouraging and facilitating the organisation of Python related user groups and
>   community workshops in Australia;

A few of the key questions that provided the initial impetus behind creating a formal
Python Australia organisation were:

* How do we make it easier for potential Python user group organisers to start a
  user group in Australian regions that currently lack one?
* How do we make it easier for organisers of existing Australian user groups to
  keep their user groups going without burning themselves out?
* How do we connect user group organisers across Australia with visiting potential
  speakers that are in the area for their own reasons, but might be open to speaking
  at the local user group?
* How do we reduce the personal liability risk for organisers of Python related
  user groups and community workshops in Australia?

It is these motivating questions that earned this clause the first position in the list
of activity clauses, as without these considerations, it's unlikely that the idea of a
formally constituted Python Australia organisation would have ever gained momentum.

While an informal information sharing community with a decent public web presence could
potentially help with the first two or three of these questions, the best such a group
could offer for the last of these concerns is suggestions on how to work with the
organisation physically hosting the meetup to assume corporate liability.

A formally incorporated legal entity has more options available for helping out in this
area than any informal group ever will (and some of those additional options are discussed
in more detail when reviewing the later activity clauses).

"Community workshops" are specifically called out so that encouraging and facilitating
events like Django Girls and Software Carpentry workshops is explicitly considered to be
in scope for the organisation.

### The "Python adoption" activity clause

The second ("Python adoption" or "career path") activity clause reads:

> * encouraging and facilitating the adoption of Python, and Python related technology,
>   in Australian educational, professional, and enthusiast settings;

This activity clauses echoes the *first* half of the PSF's essential mission statement:

> The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the
> Python programming language, ...

While the concept of Python Australia primarily arose from supporting the folks that are
active members of the Australian Python community (such as organisers, speakers, and
attendees at various community events), part of supporting a community that is centred
around a particular piece of technology is to promote general interest in that technology
at large, even amongst those that don't choose to become active community members.

For this clause in particular, it's important to note that the promotional aspect applies
to the organisation as a whole, not necessarily to any particular event.
It's also essential to note that "We promote Python" does *not* imply an attitude of
"We denigrate the alternatives to Python". As the
["Culture of PyCon AU"](https://2024.pycon.org.au/about/culture/) summarises:

> This event is designed for developers, users, and practitioners of the Python
> programming language, but we do not put down other languages to lift ourselves up.
> This includes putdowns of users of other programming languages purely based on the
> fact they don’t use Python.

If anyone feels compelled to mock programming, they can
[freely mock Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)
(pun fully intended and gleefully perpetrated).

### The "conference" activity clause

The third ("conference") activity clause reads:

> * encouraging and facilitating the provision of Python related conferences in Australia;

Since its inception, PyCon AU has operated under the auspices of Linux Australia, as a
Linux Foundation subcommittee. The formation of Python Australia does *not* imply that
there will be any immediate changes to the way PyCon AU operates: whether it ever makes
sense to change the operating model is a decision that will be made independently by the
organisers of PyCon AU (in discussion with Linux Australia and Python Australia,
assuming the latter is ever in a position to even consider taking on that responsibility).

Instead, the piece that Python Australia would be aiming to assist with is the knowledge
transfer between successive conference organisers that takes place *outside* the Linux
Australia subcommittee processes. While there are informal channels where this knowledge
transfer may take place, there are definitely opportunities to make the relevant information
more generally accessible and discoverable.

### The "relationship management" activity clause

The fourth ("relationship management") activity clause reads:

> * encouraging and facilitating long-term relationships, financial or otherwise, with entities
>   that wish to support, and effectively engage with, the Australian Python community;

Another key question that helped provide the initial impetus behind creating a formal
Python Australia organisation was:

* How do we make it easier for organisers of local Python user groups to find potential sponsors
  and/or recurring venues for their meetup?

Quite frequently, these arrangement are based on specific individuals within the local user
groups, which means they can falter if those individual change jobs, or stop being actively
involved in the organisation of that user group.

One of the goals of establishing a formal organisation is to put more explicit structures
in place to help maintain and grow these relationships, such that local sponsorship and
hosting agreements are able to continue even after the individuals that initially set
them up (on either side) have moved on.

A further goal is to attempt to broaden connections made with national (or multinational)
organisations with offices in multiple locations to support their local Python user groups
in all of those locations, not just the location where an initial connection is made.

In the other direction, there may be organisations that recognise the potential recruiting
and knowledge transfer benefits of being more actively involved with their local Python
community, but don't have anyone already on staff that can personally facilitate those
connections. In such situations, it would be part of the mission of Python Australia to
help those organisations establish the connections they may otherwise struggle to make.

### The "international Python engagement" activity clause

The fifth ("international Python engagement") activity clause reads:

> * facilitating the involvement of Python Australia members in the wider
>   international Python community;

Most of the activity clauses are naturally quite inward looking, since the focus of
"Python Australia" is unsurprisingly "the Australian Python community". This clause
and the next one are both variations on the same idea of "Don't be too insular".

The Python community is global, and this clause is intended to act as a reminder to
look beyond Australian shores for inspiration and for potential opportunities for
engagement and collaboration.

The organisational purpose of this clause is to explicitly bring relationship
building with other Python-related organisations within the scope of the
"relationship management" clause, regardless of whether or not those
organisations have a presence of their own in Australia.

### The "open source participation" activity clause

The sixth ("open source participation") activity clause reads:

> * facilitating the involvement of Python Australia members in the wider
>   open source community;

Just as the previous clause is a reminder to not be too geographically
insular, this one is an explicit reminder to not be too technologically
insular.

Python itself builds on a significant stack of tools and libraries
written in languages other than Python (with C, C++, Rust, and Fortran
being some of the most well known examples). Even the name of the
reference interpreter implementation ("CPython") mentions a second
language.

Most non-trivial Python applications will depend on a wide variety of
language neutral open source data transfer formats, and many of them
will be deployed to an open source operating system in Linux or BSD.

Assorted compelling Python development productivity tools are written
in languages other than Python, and there are a multitude of applications
written in a wide variety of languages that embed a Python runtime.

As with the previous clause, the organisational purpose of this clause is to
explicitly bring relationship building with other open source organisations
(most notably, Linux Australia) within the scope of the "relationship
management" clause.

### The "research" activity clause

The seventh ("research") activity clause reads:

> * facilitating Python related research in the public interest;

This clause echoes the corresponding activity clause in the PSF mission statement:

> * Encourages and facilitates Python-related research in the public interest.

The wording is softened slightly in the Python Australia clause because it is expected
that most research into the Python ecosystem will be international in scope, and hence
the PSF will be a better point of contact for researchers.

The organisational purpose of this clause is to help ensure that if researchers
*do* contact Python Australia for assistance, any related discussion will be free
to focus on the substance of the query, rather than having to first debate whether
or not responding to the query is within the scope of the organisation.

### The "member advocacy" activity clause

The eighth ("member advocacy") activity clause reads:

> * engaging with regulatory bodies and other government agencies and industry organisations
>   as necessary to protect the interests of Python Australia members;

One of the recurring points raised as a benefit of creating a formally incorporated legal
entity (over using a more ad hoc informal structure) is that an appropriately structured
organisation can make representations to the government (and other entities) on behalf
of its members. Even if (as expected) the incorporation structure includes a non-voting
membership tier, those members can still choose to withdraw from their membership if they
feel their interests are not being appropriately represented.

The organisational purpose of this clause is help ensure that if a situation arises where
the Board of the day feels it would be in the interests of their members to express a
formal position (such as responding to a government request for public comment, or
submitting a friend of the court brief in a potentially precedent setting or disrupting
court case), any related discussion will be free to focus on the specifics of the situation,
rather than having to first debate whether or not holding and expressing an official
position on *any* topic is within the scope of the organisation.

Note: choosing to include this clause places constraints on the *kind* of legal
entity that Python Australia can be under Australian regulations (most notably, it
makes it nearly *certain* that the organisation can't be considered a charity that
accepts tax-deductible donations). As a result, the draft mission statement and the
draft constitution need to be considered together (it's unlikely the organisation
would be eligible for classification as a charity regardless, but it's an aspect
worth mentioning).

### The "fundraising" activity clause

The ninth ("fundraising") activity clause reads:

> * raising and managing funds to support the above activities in compliance with
>   non-profit regulations in Australia; and

One of the most useful things that a formal legal entity can do that an ad hoc
informal group can't is to help navigate the often labyrinthine processes of
actually *receiving* sponsorship funds from large organisations. (Anyone
that has made it through the process of adding Linux Australia to a corporate
supplier management system in order to pay for a PyCon AU sponsorship is currently
both nodding and shuddering).

Several of the other proposed organisational activities are also likely to be
pursued more effectively if the organisation is able to put some concrete
funding behind them.

The organisational purpose of this clause is to explicitly acknowledge this
point, and to set the expectation that it will happen. It is inspired by
the comparable clause in the PSF mission statement, which begins:

> * Raises funds to support PSF programs and services. The regulations for
>   public charity funding are complex. ...

### The "service provision" activity clause

The tenth ("service provision") activity clause reads:

> * providing services in support of the above activities. This includes,
>   but is not limited to, operating a public website and social media presence.

Similar to the fundraising clause, this is another pragmatic acknowledgement clause
that could potentially go without saying, but we include it explicitly so it doesn't
*need* to go without saying.

The "This includes, but is not limited to ..." phrasing (with specific examples)
is a way to ensure certain minimum service expectations are set, without having
their inclusion imply that other services *can't* be provided. (As with many of
the previous clauses, this idea is again taken from the PSF mission statement,
where the clause covering python.org, PyCon US, and the PSF Grants Program has
a comparable structure).

### The organisational independence statement

The final organisational independence statement reads:

> Python Australia is an independent legal entity incorporated in Australia that is not formally
> affiliated with the Python Software Foundation. However, this mission statement is intended to
> be compatible with, and actively support, the global mission of the Python Software Foundation.

The draft mission statement echoes several elements of the Python Software Foundation's own
mission statement, and we want to make it clear that those similarities are intentional
rather than accidental.

However, we also don't want to create the impression that a formal affiliation or endorsement
exists between the two organisations, as the references to "Python" and the "Python Software
Foundation" in the draft mission statement are purely nominative ones.

This final statement aims to achieve both goals by explicitly stating the organisation's
independence, disclaiming any formal affiliation, and only then expressing explicit support
for the PSF's own mission.
